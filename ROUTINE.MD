##  Routine

#### Much like anything else I have done over the years, *"time in the saddle"* is the only way I have found for mastering a skill.  Spending time in the saddle with tech has me a bit scared.  I'm faced with all of these questions while I venture into this new field.   
- Which projects do I tackle?  
- How do I best spend my time?  How do I make myself an asset for a hiring manager to take interest in me? 
-  What is the best way to stand out in the crowd?

#### When I take a step back, and look at my accomplishments in other fields, I realize that for the most part, it has come from me putting my head down, and not basing my accomplishments on others.  I instead, need to focus on myself, and learning new skills at my own pace.  I need to focus my energy, and create a space for myself to grow.

#### That leads me to my main focus at the beginning of the year. Creating a routine.  Although I have worked from home in the past, I've never spent as much time at home as I currently am.  From flying across the country a few weeks out of the month, my schedule was anything but routine.  Now that my travels have been put on hold, this is a unique opportunity to give myself a hard reset, and explore what life at home looks like.  This space will give me a way to start structuring a routine that works for me.  

##### Tips for a routine below.  

    1. Decide what needs to be in your routine. Do you want to get more exercise or more alone time? Prioritizing what is important to you before starting is key!
    1. Set small goals. Break each large goal into smaller goals. While a big goal is exciting to tackle, it is what often leads to failure as we take on too much. If your overall goal is to eat healthier meals, start by changing one thing a day, every day, to build confidence. When you accomplish that, congratulate yourself!  
    1. Layout a plan. Start with one week at a time and start small – that way you can build on simple accomplishments. Write it all out on a calendar, almost like an appointment.
    1. Be consistent with time. If you want to get a daily walk in, attempt it at the same time every day. Completing your tasks first thing in the morning before losing motivation allows you to enjoy benefits all day. If you want to get to the gym, do it on your way to or from work, you will have more success.  Most people won’t want to leave the warm house once they get home.
    1. Be prepared. When deciding upon a new routine, make sure you have all the pieces before you start; this will make it easier to get started without any delay. For example, if a new resolution is to clean the house every Saturday morning, make sure your vacuum cleaner is working properly and you have all the cleaning materials needed.
    1. Make it fun! Getting into a new routine and new goals aren’t always fun, but there are ways to make it fun. Find a workout buddy, get a good playlist for cleaning and try new cooking classes – anything to help you enjoy your new routine.
    1. Track your progress. Create a visual calendar that you can cross off each day that you complete the task. Most people don’t want to “break the chain” and see a missing spot on their calendar.
    1. Reward yourself. Once you have fallen into a routine on a consistent basis, reward yourself with something fun. For example, if your goal was to get into a routine of picking up clutter every night before bed, reward yourself with new slippers that you can enjoy around the clean house.
